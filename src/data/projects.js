After the full functional initial prototype was created and went on to become a product, I took on the role of lead developer  (front and backend) as well as functional product owner for the following two years, working with the contracted data analysts, GE’s data analytics team and CRM teams to integrate the features with their products.<br/>During this period I went on to become machine learning certified with Apache Spark to better understand and help the team with prediction accuracy issues.",

In addition the manual investigation steps to decide to dispatch a call, and the search through several databases to find out who is the best trained field engineer to take that call is time consuming.",
    "action":"As a solo full stack developer, paired with a User experience designer,   I had the opportunity to work on all facet of this product  from  its original idea to product ready phase. My ability to always stay current with the technologies available allowed me to introduced two major changes to our development stack going from angular 1.4 to 2.0 and machine learning trained on service history and training data to find the best field engineer for the job. <br/> Since this was a solo development job, the ability to multitask, organize and see the bigger picture were essential to see this project through the finish line.",

During this time, and due to the high demand of this project, I also became a Siebel developer taking over the role for the remainder of my time with the team.",
    "result":"SynerGE streamlined the user experience for field engineers reducing the amount of clicks (and time) to complete an entire service call from 250 to 120 clicks.  My full stack development background played a crucial role in overcoming challenges to bring together different legacy platforms (and information) not thought possible before. Under my leadership, with proper planning and above average technical skills, the SynerGE team was able to go from concept to ready-to-use product in record time. <br/> SynerGE directly impacted the business by increasing the amount of calls taken per FE each day by 20%. The application has a total of 435 active daily users processing an average of 12 service calls per day. SynerGE has processed over 1.2 million calls since its release.",
